<h1>City Districts</h1>
Datapack for Minecraft 1.17.1+! Lets you create RPG-Like titles in certain areas that show up when you walk over them. Good for roleplaying or adding a bit of extra flair to a build. Works great in multiplayer too!<br>

- Features 11 Different Title Colors
  - Aqua (Light Blue Banner)
  - Dark Aqua (Cyan Banner)
  - Dark Green (Green Banner)
  - Dark Purple (Purple Banner)
  - Dark Red (Red Banner)
  - Gold (Orange Banner)
  - Gray (Light Gray Banner)
  - Green (Lime Banner)
  - Light Purple (Pink Banner)
  - White (White Banner)
  - Yellow (Yellow Banner)
- Simply grab one of the banners above, rename it to what you want to name your City/Town/Location, and toss/throw the banner onto an armor stand.
- When you create or delete a city district, it announces it to players nearby in chat.
- Locations are marked with little particles, walking nearby will display the title.
  - Titles will only appear when walking over the particles, so these are best placed near entrances and exits, rather than in the middle of your build.
- Delete the city district markers by setting the block underneath it on fire.
